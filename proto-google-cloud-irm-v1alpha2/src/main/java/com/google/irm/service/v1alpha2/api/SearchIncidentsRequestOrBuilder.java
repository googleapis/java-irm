   * An expression that defines which incidents to return.
   * Search atoms can be used to match certain specific fields.  Otherwise,
   * plain text will match text fields in the incident.
   * Search atoms:
   * * `start` - (timestamp) The time the incident started.
   * * `stage` - The stage of the incident, one of detected, triaged, mitigated,
   *   resolved, documented, or duplicate (which correspond to values in the
   *   Incident.Stage enum). These are ordered, so `stage&lt;resolved` is
   *   equivalent to `stage:detected OR stage:triaged OR stage:mitigated`.
   * * `severity` - (Incident.Severity) The severity of the incident.
   *    + Supports matching on a specific severity (for example,
   *    `severity:major`) or on a range (for example, `severity&gt;medium`,
   *    `severity&lt;=minor`, etc.).
   * Timestamp formats:
   * * yyyy-MM-dd - an absolute date, treated as a calendar-day-wide window.
   *   In other words, the "&lt;" operator will match dates before that date, the
   *   "&gt;" operator will match dates after that date, and the ":" or "="
   *   operators will match the entire day.
   * * Nd (for example, 7d) - a relative number of days ago, treated as a moment
   *   in time (as opposed to a day-wide span). A multiple of 24 hours ago (as
   *   opposed to calendar days).  In the case of daylight savings time, it will
   *   apply the current timezone to both ends of the range.  Note that exact
   *   matching (for example, `start:7d`) is unlikely to be useful because that
   *   would only match incidents created precisely at a particular instant in
   *   time.
   * Examples:
   * * `foo` - matches incidents containing the word "foo"
   * * `"foo bar"` - matches incidents containing the phrase "foo bar"
   * * `foo bar` or `foo AND bar` - matches incidents containing the words "foo"
   *   and "bar"
   * * `foo -bar` or `foo AND NOT bar` - matches incidents containing the word
   *   "foo" but not the word "bar"
   * * `foo OR bar` - matches incidents containing the word "foo" or the word
   *   "bar"
   * * `start&gt;2018-11-28` - matches incidents which started after November 11,
   *   2018.
   * * `start&lt;=2018-11-28` - matches incidents which started on or before
   *   November 11, 2018.
   * * `start:2018-11-28` - matches incidents which started on November 11,
   *   2018.
   * * `start&gt;7d` - matches incidents which started after the point in time 7*24
   *   hours ago
   * * `start&gt;180d` - similar to 7d, but likely to cross the daylight savings
   *   time boundary, so the end time will be 1 hour different from "now."
   * * `foo AND start&gt;90d AND stage&lt;resolved` - unresolved incidents from the
   *   past 90 days containing the word "foo"
